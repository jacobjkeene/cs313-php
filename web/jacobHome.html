<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>My main interests are: Music, Gaming, Anime, hanging out with friends, and God.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I love music. It started when my mom began teaching me the piano when I was 6 years old. I love how music helps you feel excited and happy. I also love how music helps you calm down and relax. It can also help you cry away your worries. Some music can even transport you and take you on a journey. My favorite genres are hardcore, rock, epic, dubstep, hip-hop, punk, screamo, and classical.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Alot of people like to game or play videogames. I personally play videogames for a couple reasons. I love exploring the story. I like finding out who the characters are, their motives, and what happens to them on this journey. I think of videogames like virtual books. However, you as the player sometimes get alot of control of what happens to them. I also like playing with friends. Working together to accomplish something feels satisfying. Also most videogames have a great music selection to listen to. I can't say I have a favorite videogame, because I enjoy so many of them. However, my favorite videogame characters are: Cloud, Arthas, and Illidan. Cloud is from Final Fantasy series. Arthas and Illidan are from the Warcraft series.</p>

<h3>Anime</h3>
<p>Anime is another source of great music. It helps build tension and suspense. I love anime because it has a playful nature, but can carry a powerful message. I like how it can be super funny as it explores a universe that sometimes can be vastly different from ours. I also don't have a favorite anime, but feel free to talk to me if you are looking for one to watch. I mostly watch sport, comedy, school, adventure, and fantasy animes.</p>

<h3>God</h3>
<p>Last, but not least, is I'm fascinated with God. I love looking for His hand in my life. I mostly recognize it in music. Sometimes, while I listen to music, it feels like He takes me on a journey to recognize the big picture of life. I also recognize Him in videogames and Anime. Usually a character mirrors an attribute of Christ so beautifully. I know God is in our lives, even in the small details. One day, I hope I can rewatch my life, and see the things He did for me.</p>
